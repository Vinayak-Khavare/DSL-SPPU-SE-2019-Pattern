# In second year computer engineering class, group A studentâ€™s play cricket, group B students play badminton and group C students play
# football. Write a Python program using functions to compute following: - a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton 
# b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton 
# d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton. (Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should 
# be avoided, Do not use SET built-in functions)
